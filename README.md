# 100-Days-of-Code-Python-Bootcamp-Day-16-Coffee-Maker-OOP

# Purpose of the project
This project is a solution Angela Yu's Days 16 of a 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp course. The goal is to make a coffee maker machine that asks the user to choose a drink from a list of available beverages. The user is then asked to add money to the machine and is served the drink if the transaction is successful. The user also has an option to ask for a report of the available ingredients and money in the machine.

# What I learned creating this project
I learn the basics of working with JSON files in Python, because I wanted to permanently store the list of ingredients and money the machine could work with.
I also practiced working with OOP.

# What I need to work on
I need to keep working on OOP and learn more about error handling.
